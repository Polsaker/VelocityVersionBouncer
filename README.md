# VelocityVersionBouncer
**A simple and fully automated way to connect players to the correct server based on their game version.**

**VelocityVersionBouncer** is a plugin for the [Velocity proxy](https://papermc.io/software/velocity) (tested on version 3.4) that automatically selects the most compatible backend server for a connecting player, based on their protocol version (Minecraft game version).

---
### 🔧 How It Works
- Everytime a client connects to your proxy the plugin will check all the registered servers and compare their protocol versions (game versions).
- By default, the first server that matches will be selected (you can change that in the config).
- There is a config.toml file located in the plugins folder (`plugins/VelocityVersionBouncer/config.toml`).
- The clients can be routed automatically or based on the explicit routings set in the config.
- Optional features include: a fallback functionality as well as comparing versions for server list pings.
- You can also change the plugins language (currently `en_US`, `zh_CN` and `de_DE` are available).
### ❓ Questions you may have:
- **Is this also triggered when changing servers via `/server`?** No, the version checking is only triggered when connecting initially (from the multiplayer server list) or when using the fallback functionality.
- **What happens if no compatible server is found?** The configured `fallback-server` is used as a last resort. If it is not set, the client is disconnected with the corresponding note/reason.
- **Does this work with modded minecraft servers?** If you're using setups like Ambassador+ProxyCompatibleForge [(more information)](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/server-compatibility) this plugin will route the client based purely on their protocol version (game version), not their installed mods. _Note: This setup has only been tested with PaperMC and (Neo)Forge servers._
### 📦 Installation & 🛠️ Requirements
1. Download the `.jar` file of the last stable release ([here](https://github.com/Hallo5000/VelocityVersionBouncer/blob/master/build/libs/VelocityVersionBouncer-1.6.0-release.jar)) or build it yourself (the gradle files are included).
2. Put the file in your servers `plugins/` folder (only the proxy!) and restart the server once to generate the config file at `plugins/velocityversionbouncer/config.toml`.
3. When you're finished editing the config restart the proxy once more and everything should be working.
_Note: this plugin may not work properly if you are not running on `Java 21` (or higher) and `Velocity 3.4.0` or above_
4. If you're having problems: make sure you're not using a snapshot (as these are expected to be unstable and this README is always explaining the latest release anyway), if there's still a problem feel free to open an issue on the plugins GitHub repository.

## Example Config:
```toml
# This config is used to determine how and if servers are checked for their protocol versions whenever a client tries to connect to a backend server (and optionally if they lost connection)

# en_US zh_CN de_DE
language = "en_US"

# 'whitelist' is a string array of server names to check for their protocol version when a client tries to connect.
# leaving this empty is equal to putting all registered servers in
# Example: ["server1", "server2"]
# Note: spaces outside the strings will be ignored.
whitelist = ["lobby1", "lobby2", "fun-minigame", "devServer"]

# 'blacklist' is an array of strings to exclude from the temporary list of servers during version comparison.
# first the whitelist is added and then all servers contained in the blacklist are removed from that temporary list.
blacklist = ["devServer"]

# If enabled this option ensures that joining players will be distributed evenly over all servers
# Options: (case-insensitive)
#   "FIRST-MATCH" - players will be sent to the first matching server
#   "BALANCED" - players will be evenly distributed over all matching servers
distribution = "FIRST-MATCH"

# The server to use as a last resort when no compatible and available server can be found.
# This server is not checked for compatibility or availability. Leave empty to disable.
fallback-server = ""

# This option if set to 'true' lets you override verlocity's way of determining the server list ping response by using the try-list of the config ('ping-passthrough')
# instead when a client sends a server ping it will use the same algorithm to determine a matching server as in the joining/fallback process
# be carefully when also using clientbrands in the explicit routings as these can't be used to match server pings
server-list-ping = false
# This option determines wether to use velocities ping-passthrough when no matching server was found for the ping response
# If set to true, things like the description will probably show but the client shows that the version doesn't match,
# otherwise the client will display "Can't connect to server"
# This option will also be ignored if 'server-list-ping' is set to false
default-to-ping-passthrough = true

# This defines how often all backend servers get pinged to refresh infos in the plugins ping cache
# in seconds
ping-intervall = 300

# If enabled this option ensures that whenever a client is kicked from a server (whether during login, via /kick, or for another reason),
# they will be automatically redirected (bounced) to another server instead of being disconnected. (obviously if a client disconnects explicitly via leaving the server they will not be redirected)
enable-fallback-bouncing = true
# If set to true, the server the client was kicked from will be temporarily excluded from fallback options,
# preventing the client from being sent back there during fallback-bouncing.
exclude-previous-server = false
# When there is a valid server name in 'explicit-fallback-server' the plugin won't search for a new server and instead only tries the specified server.
# Leave this empty, if you'd like to disable this option (also this is disabled when enable-fallback-bouncing is set to false).
explicit-fallback-server = "lobby"

# ------ explicit routing ------
# Syntax
#   vX_X_X - game version
#   p000 - protocol version (Protocol version numbers for every release/snapshot can be found here: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Minecraft_Wiki:Projects/wiki.vg_merge/Protocol_version_numbers)
#   cXYZ - Client brand (for example: vanilla, forge, fabric, Geyser (for player joining through GeyserMC), badlion, etc.
# either a game version (v) or a protocol version (p) is necessary but client brands (c) are completely optional
# when no client brand is defined the routing just takes every client joining with the defined game/protocol version
[explicit-routing]
# Example: v1_21_8cFORGE = "lobby-1"
# Example: p123 = "lobby-2"
# Example: cGeyser = "GeyserMC-server"

# Controls fallback behavior when a selected server disconnects or rejects a player.
# Servers not listed here default to true, preserving the normal fallback behavior.
[fallback-on-connect-failure]
lobby1 = false
